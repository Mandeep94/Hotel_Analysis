"TRTW","Henderson, Nevada","I was on a budget and was looking for a place to stay while in L.A. Fortunately, I found this place at a very reasonable price. Arriving late at night I notice the parking lot was FULL. I mean, my car could only move in one direction as the cars were too close to one another. They may have had a group staying in the hotel that night. The check-in clerk was nice and showed me where to park (in between two handicap spaces that said 'NO PARKING'). I was worried I would get a ticket but the clerk said it's only for one night. The room was nice. It had all the basic necessities one needs. I like how there were a lot of TV stations and the Internet connection was fast. Early in the morning I went down to get breakfast and the room was very small. Food selection was ok but opted to eat at a restaurant that served breakfast. I toured L.A. for the day and upon my return to the room it was clean. HOWEVER, I realized the cleaning staff took all my soap away and forgot to replace them. So at 10 p.m., I went downstairs to the lobby and asked for soap. I got a facial soap (as that's what was left). I had to use this small facial soap in taking a shower. Anyway, I gave this place a Very Good rating because the room was overall comfortable, the price was reasonable, and it was close to the freeway (to get to where I want). What I didn't like was the parking, breakfast, and the fact they forgot to put soap in my room. I'd still stay here if money is tight or I want to save. By the way, if you plan to use the pool it's very small.","November 5, 2011","","","4","5","4.0","4","4","5","5","UR120202096","“Reasonably Priced for L.A. Area”"
"lindyhopper63","Waxahachie, Texas","Rooms were nice with refrigerator and microwave. The continental breakfast could have been better. I was able to print my boarding pass from their computer in the lobby and they did not charge a fee. Beds were very comfortable. They are right next to the on ramp that takes you to LAX, and yet you do not hear any freeway noise from the room. (which was nice!!)","August 11, 2011","","","5","","4.0","","3","5","4","UR116586908","“Great place to crash”"
"AZ_Traveler1900","Tucson, AZ","This property is located at the insection of CA 134 & CA 2, which makes it convient to get around, but also means there is some highway noise which may bother some customers. Pros: Clean Room Centrally located to Northern LA Attractions (Pasadena, Dodger Stadium, Hollywood) Good continental breakfast. Friendly staff Cons: Price It is a Motel not Hotel The Motel is not all non-smoking, you must ask to be away from smoking rooms. Pool is not heated as the Best Western website claims I asked the front desk staff about the reported ""bed bugs"" from another post, they reported that an inspection was performed by a pest company but found none. If there are any confirmed cases of ""bed bugs"" the hotel discards all bedding and mattresses and performs deep clean.","June 4, 2011","","","5","","3.0","","3","3","2","UR111424820","“Not worth the price.”"
"DCH47","Chula Vista, California","Avoid this place like the plague! Not only is it well past its prime, but our room was infested with bedbugs. I was attacked by bedbugs, so I called the desk, and showed the night manager the many bugs in my bed as well as my bites and the bloody sheets. She sent us to another room, which was not made up. We finally got a third room and after another shower spent a fitful, basically sleepless night. The bites were severe enough that they required medical attention when I returned home, certainly not what I expected. I understand that bedbugs can infest even the most upscale hotels, but I expect the management to deal with problems quickly and competently. It took many e-mails and unreturned phone calls to the manager to finally get a vouchefr for a free night. This was not satisfactory to me, so I called the Best Western customer relations department and was credited with 20,000 points. I thought the points were in addition to the free night, as I would never have accepted one free night for the pain and inconvenience I suffered. When I tried to use the voucher at a subsequent stay at another Best Western, I learned that the Eagle Rock had cancelled it. So much for taking care of customers. There would have been no amount of money I could have been paid to stay in this hotel had I known I would be eaten alive by bedbugs. I thought the voucher plus the points was barely satisfactory, but by that point I was tired of the weeks of hastle. I guess the Eagle Rock management thinks letting you stay free if you're attacked as I was is enough. If you're willing to be bitten by bedbugs to get a free night (and that only after persistent phone calls and e-mails), the Eagle Rock is the place for you. Otherwise, I suggest you find someplace else. Almost anywhere else would be an improvement.","May 25, 2011","","","2","2","1.0","1","1","1","1","UR109876274","“BEDBUGS, BEDBUGS, BEDBUGS”"
"jmullins762","Lancaster, California","My wife and I stayed here when our price was accepted on Priceline. I was able to upgrade to a King size bed at no additional cost. The room was a bit dated, but had a large flat screen tv, refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. The bed was fairly comfortable. The down sides to the room was that there was a huge mirror on one wall, next to the bed. This might be a plus for some, but I didn't appreciate it at all. Another down side was that the air conditioning had to run all night to cool the room down. Suggestion would be to arrive early if you can, and turn it on before you go out for the evening. Breakfast-I have seen reviews that were positive. We did not have that experience. Yes,they had waffles, toaster waffles. not fresh. The breakfast room was very small with minimal seating. There were guests there that took up all the space and I had to reach around them often to get food that I had left on the counter. They ran out of decaf coffee, orange juice and the milk was hidden in the refrigerator. We would have had a more relaxing and enjoyable breakfast somewhere else, but since it was included in the room price, it was okay. Went to IKEA in Burbank later and got a good cup of coffee there before shopping! I would probably stay at this motel again, it was quiet, despite being right next to a freeway, but would probably skip the breakfast. I didn't have a need to use the WiFi so I can't comment on that. .","August 22, 2010","","","5","4","4.0","4","4","4","5","UR76386256","“A nice place to stay, but plan for breakfast elsewhere!”"
"TravelsOften651","Twin Cities","Overall, this hotel is in a busy area...but it wasn't too bad. My only complaint was needing the computer for my work. It is for customer's use (sitting at the front desk)...and the employee at the front desk always has it facing towards them so they can do stuff on it. It got a little old constantly having to ask them if I could use it...since I am paying for it. Nice & deep pool, good sized hot tub. Breakfast is pretty bleak...but better than nothing. The hallways are outdoor hallways, but it helps that they have an elevator. If you are looking for a decent stay and an affordable rate, this place will do!","June 3, 2010","","","4","5","4.0","4","3","4","5","UR66271300","“Decent Place To Stay”"
"Vale23","Parabiago, Italy","My husband and I stayed at the Best Western in Glendale, LA, for three night and have only just checked out. Our experience was overall good. We rented a car in LA, so we needed a parking lot at the hotel. At this BW, you'll have it complimentary. We were given a room right above the breakfast room. It was spacious enough for two and clean (I'm not a great fan of carpet, though). The only downside is the air conditioning: it is not adequate and really noisy. Wi-fi connection worked well and the breakfast was good: they'll serve you waffles, bagels, toasted bread, cereals, eggs, fruit and coffee, tea and milk. There is a swimming pool but it is tiny, we never used it anyway. Being right off a ramp, the hotel is well connected to other points in town.","September 3, 2009","","","4","4","4.0","3","4","","4","UR39635339","“Good deal in LA”"
"Peachy16","Winnipeg, Canada","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nites. The hotel was clean, comfortable, good location that had close proximity to get into LA. Front desk staff was very Friendly & helpful any time we spoke with them. It was the only hotel I was able to find that had free parking anywhere in LA, which came in handy. The hotel did have a pool, but we didn't get the chance to check it out. We were not a fan of the room decor - mirrors EVERYWHERE, on every wall! The air conditioning was adequate at best, and we spotted a cobweb (complete with spider) in the bathroom shower window. Overall we would probably stay at this hotel again, should we come back to the LA area, and would recommennd this to others, with the knowledge this is a cheap & cheerful property that will give you a place to sleep.","July 21, 2009","","","3","4","3.0","3","4","","4","UR35423247","“Typical Best Western”"

"TravelFan176","Columbia, South Carolina","I stayed 20+ nights at this motel while working for the city of Glendale. I worked long hours and this was really just a place to sleep and shower. This motel is old, but it meets two important criteria, it is very clean and all the plumbing works well. It also had a frig., microwave and good (free) wireless internet. The staff is accomodating and I negotiated a rate of $77/night with the manager for my long stay, which was well below other area motels w/ similar features. If you plan to spend a lot of time at the motel property, then this may not be your place, but if you want a clean room while visiting attractions, transiting from one place to another, or if you are a business traveler that is just looking for a clean place to sleep, then the Best Western Eagle Rock should meet your needs. Note, this place has an L.A. address, but there is a sign 10' from their driveway that says welcome to Glendale, CA.","March 3, 2008","3","3","5","4","4.0","4","4","","4","UR14009882","“Reasonable Price and Clean”"
"Humbridge","North Yorkshire","Spent 2 nights at the Eagle Rock. It is quite conveniently located for many LA attactions. The room was clean and comfortable, though this is not the most recently renovated hotel and is probably about due for some updating. The staff were friendly. The hotel is close to Eagle Rock and Glendale, so plenty of places to eat, though very close promiximity to the highway makes it quite noisy. Parking is quite limited. All in all, a reasonable place to stay with no significant complaints, though not somewhere that I would rush back to.","May 26, 2007","3","3","3","4","3.0","3","4","","3","UR7698160","“Reasonable”"
"FabulousTravels","Oakland, CA","The room is clean and the shower is good. Everything is good with the room itself. You are, however, on a very busy street and every room looks onto the street. You're also just feet from a freeway overpass. This wasn't a problem for me since I am a sound sleeper, but could see it being an issue for a restless sleeper. Otherwise, staff is nice, no problems. Not in a cute part of town or anything, too far to walk to Eagle Rock & shops.","April 8, 2007","","5","5","3","3.0","5","5","","3","UR7293853","“Average Place to Stay”"
"pixiedreamer","California","This place is oddly placed on the map or at least to get to it but overall, it was decent. I wasn't ever worried about loud neighbors or too much traffic even if it is off the highway. the only place I ever heard the traffic was in the bathroom but the window was open, so... it was quiet other than that. the little ponds and decor had a japanese feel to it. it was very nice, great price, and close to two freeways. Not much around the hotel but if you have a car, you can get around and it's not that far from places (the longest drive I communted was probably 30 minutes). Nice for couples and families, not so great for frat parties. I'd definitely stay here again.","December 10, 2006","4","3","5","3","3.0","4","4","","3","UR6358331","“A good find”"
